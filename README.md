# HexChess
HexChess is a hexagonal chess program powered with the Godot Engine. It includes several variants of hex chess (Glinski, McCooey, Hexofen), basic AI and peer-to-peer multiplayer.

To manipulate the source code you'll need Godot 3.5 .NET version. The code is licensed under the MIT license, feel free to use it in your projects. However, there are additional restrictions on some visual assets; check subdirectories for more info.

Starting from version 2.0, the app includes a portion of code written in Rust. If you want to compile it, refer to the Rust/Godot setup instructions [here](https://godot-rust.github.io/book/gdnative/intro/setup.html). Additionally, check the [wiki](https://github.com/macalimlim/godot-rust-template/wiki) for the Godot-Rust template upon which this app relies.
